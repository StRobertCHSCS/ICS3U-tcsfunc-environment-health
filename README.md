# Functions + Topics in Computer Science (Environment &amp; Health)


## Assignment Objectives
* Think critically about the negative effects of computer use on the environment and on human health
* Apply knowledge of functions in Python to create an animated scene.

## Curriculum Expectations
* D1.1 describe the negative effects of computer use on the environment and on human health.
* D1.2 identify measures that help reduce the impact of computers on the environment and on human health 
* C2.3 use standard procedures to back up and archive user files.
* A3.1 demonstrate the ability to use existing subprograms within computer programs
A3.2 write subprograms (e.g., functions, proce- dures) that use parameter passing and appropriate variable scope (e.g., local, global),
to perform tasks within programs.

## Part 1 - Article & Response

### Step 1 - Sign up to Flipboard
[Sign up with Flipboard.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MFu7yAbYy8OmR93q37JYm04KME2b08t1d4mdv1arABc/edit?usp=sharing) and use the search tool to follow topics related to this course.


### Step 2 - Find an article
Find an article related to the *negative effects* of computer use on the environment and on human health.

### Step 3 - Analysis
In the **response.md** file, use  [markdown language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in Pycharm to properly format a response in the following manner: 

#### Section 1 (250 words)
* What are the negative effects described in the article?
* Describe the implications of these effects?

#### Section 2 (250 words)
* Identify measures that help reduce the impact of computers on the environment and on human health 

### Formatting
As mentioned above, you will use [markdown language](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to properly format your response.
* Use subheader formatting to organize your response in the indicated sections.
* Use [link formatting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) to create links from important concepts in your response to other sources related to the concepts.


## Part 2 - Python Arcade
In the **arcade_assignment.py** file, use Python Arcade to create a visual representation related to the negative effect covered in **Part 1**.  You will:
* Seek opportunities to define functions to draw complex objects.  That is, these functions **should not** consist of one line of code (i.e draw a rectangle), but multiple lines to draw a cohesive object.
* Seek opportunities to define functions that use parameters to successfully position the objects or multiple instances of an objects.
* Draw text
* Optionally use an image as a background and/or as part of an object drawn by a function you've defined
* Make use of global variables to *animate* at least one object.
